# Introduction

Access to new types of data has revolutionized much of science. Yet that revolution has yet to fully make its way to the scientific study of human beings and their interactions, where progress has been hindered by the legal, technical, and operational obstacles to sharing and accessing sensitive data about individuals. New paradigms and platforms are required to enable sensitive data from different sources to be discovered, integrated, and analyzed in an appropriately controlled manner, while also allowing researchers to share analysis methods, results, and expertise in ways not easily possible today. Success in this endeavor may enable a fundamental change in how data on human beings from governments, statistical agencies, research institutions, and other organizations, are made available for research, and thus a flowering of new methods for studying human subjects.

Our goal in this class is to study the technical problems raised by sensitive data and the technical solutions that have been developed for working with this data. We will read and discuss scientific papers in the area and hear from distinguished invited speakers with experience in the development and application of those solutions. We’ll investigate not just the technologies but also the practical applications that make secure access to sensitive data so important: applications such as new scientific approaches to understanding human beings and human societies, and evidence-based policy for healthcare, poverty, and crime. Topics to be discussed include:

-	Opportunities for social science, evidence-based policy, program evaluation, and healthcare
-	Building and operating secure data enclaves 
-	Secure multi party computation
-	Statistical disclose methods such as differential privacy
-	Privacy preserving data mining 
-	Search and discovery with sensitive data
-	Data de-identification, linkage, and re-identification
-	Deployment scenarios in cities, state governments, federal government
-	Regulatory challenges and regimes
-	Methods for sharing code and reproducible research
-	The Globus safe data platform

#  Class organization

The class is held Tue/Thu 9:00-10:20am in Ryerson 277. It runs from March 28 to June 1. The instructor is Ian Foster <foster@uchicago.edu>, whose office is in Searle 222.
