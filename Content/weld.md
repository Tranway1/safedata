Conclusions from [The "Re-identification" of Governor William Weld's Medical Information: A Critical Re-examination of Health Data Identification Risks and Privacy Protections, Then and Now](https://fpf.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Re-identification-of-Governor-Welds-Medical-Information-Daniel-Barth-Jones.pdf), Daniel Barth-Jones, 2012.

What are our essential "lessons learned" from this critical examination of the seminal Weld reidentification
attack?

I would propose the following:

* Did Weldâ€™s "re-identification" have a useful and important impact on improving healthcare privacy? * Yes, quite clearly.*
* Has this event led to important regulations that help to importantly protect patients from reidentification risk? *Undoubtedly.*
* Does the Weld saga realistically reflect the privacy risks that exist under the HIPAA Privacy rules today? *No, not at all.*
* Should we let the de minimus risks of re-identification under today's HIPAA protections cause
us to abandon our use of de-identified data to save lives and improve our healthcare system?  *No, not unless we wish to abandon science and progress in favor of irrational fears.*
